    * 2020-12-17: Ver 0.9.6- Luca // Gitlab Commit = 0.9.6a
    .......................................................
       - Removed dependency from "AsyncSerialLib"
         - new class SerialCommand()
       - Remove delay() (blocking) in Countdown phase 
         - new class SoftTimer()
       - adapted to Serial Protocol 1.0
         - added serial command "@" - Enter Configuration Mode 
           (still respond to deprecated R0,R1 to enter cfg mode)
         - added serial command "K" - Set Physics parameters (weight, friction)
         - added serial command "W" - Write parameter set to EEPROM
         - updated command "B" (Pitlane cfg) to manage PERM parameter
         - updated command "A" (Slope cfg) to manage PERM parameter

    * 2020-08-26: Ver 0.9.5 - Luca 
       - Version number format changed (3 dot-separated integers) !!! 
       - added serial command Get Software ID
       - added serial command Get Software Version

    * 2020-07-28: Ver 0.9.d - Luca 
       - Tested OK on Arduino Every
       - Configuration Values NOW SAVED in EEPROM to enable 
         OLR Configuration via a Software client running on a computer.
         - Laps (Single Race duration)
         - Led Number in the Racetrack (MAXLED)
         - Box Length 
         - Ramp: init,center,end,high
         The User Interface running on the Computer is currently under development.
         Advanced users can already change Cfg Values via Serial (See Protocol documentation)
         Function Activation:
            Even if you can configure Box and Slope parameters, the activation is 
            still managed by user via Controls

       - Winner Visual effect changed (too long for 1200 MAXLED)


    * 2020-07-16: Ver 0.9.c - Luca
       - Changes in [I/O Pin]<>[Car Color] association to match
         the desired Phisical Buttons Layout (Quick Start Guide)
       - Box/Pitlane
         - Entry/exit point marked to help put in place led strip (circuit shape)
         - Coin "Boost" scaled up to make "catch it" worth (almost always win the race)
       - Minor bugfix:
         - box_init(), box_isactive() use wrong var "rampactive"
 
    * 2020-07-16: Ver 0.9.b - Gerardo
       - Sound FX added  

    * 2019-10-10 - Ver 0.9.a
